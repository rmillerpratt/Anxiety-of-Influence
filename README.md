# Anxiety-of-Influence
Mapping and Visualization Project for Translations of Fantastic Literature into Spanish during the 19th-Century

My objective with this project was to address the contentious issue of whether or not Spanish authors in the 19th century, had access to translations of non-Spanish language Fantastic texts. Specifically, I built a data set and used it to analyze frequency, location, and quantity of publications. The analysis was done through visualizations including maps and graphs. I created the data set that was used for this project by using raw data from the research of David Roas and Juan Jesús Payán Martín on Spanish language translations of Fantastic literature in the 19th-Century.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python to run the Jupyter Notebook used for this project. If you do not want to install Jupyter Notebook on your local system you have the option viewing the code in the Jupyter Notebook [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) or you can run my notebook from a brower window without downloading anything with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rmillerpratt/Anxiety-of-Influence/master?filepath=Anxiety%20of%20Influence.ipynb)

Documentation on how to install Python can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Jupyter recommends using Anaconda to install the Jupyter Notebook, but you can also install it using pip. Instructions for an Anaconda installation are [here](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and pip installation can be found [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

## Built With

* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)
* [Python](https://www.python.org)

## Files Needed

The original pdf file, original_translation_index_david_roas.pdf, that I used to build the data set, as well as my cleaned and geocoded csv, 2018_13_12_AoI_1_textonly.csv, are both included in this repository.
